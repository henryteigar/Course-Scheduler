* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/henryteigar/course-scheduler.git` 
* Being in the project root, execute `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
* To start the server, run `npm run start`. This should start the server on `http://localhost:3000`
* That's it!

### Installing for development
